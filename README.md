# How to contribute

1. The master branch is write-protected. This means you cannot write to it directly. 
2. Do all your development on the "frontend-develop" or "backend-develop" branches. 
3. When frontend and/or backend are ready, open a pull request on the "develop" branch. 
4. Vansh will review the changes and if they are good, he will accept and resolve merge conflicts. If not, he will contact the teams.
5. Vansh will open a pull request on branch "stage"
6. A member of QA (Yash or Jocelyn) will review your changes and merge the pull request to "stage" 
7. Once QA has approved your changes, they will open a pull request to merge changes with master. 
8. The PM (Rahul) will verify the pull request and merge it with master. The PM (Rahul) will also need to update CHANGELOG.md. 
9. If there are merge conflicts, the pull request will be closed.
10. If not, you're good! Project manager will comment on changes. The Slack group #android-dev will be notified on any changes to master branch.
